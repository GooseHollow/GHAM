						<b>Carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing. This and additional information can be found in the Fund’s full and summary prospectus, which may be obtained by visiting www.gham.co. Read the prospectus carefully before investing. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.</b> <br> <br> 
						
						Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. There can be no assurance that a Fund will achieve its stated objectives.<br> <br> 

						The Fund's performance, because it is a fund of funds, is dependent on the performance of the Underlying Funds. The Fund is subject to the risks of the Underlying Funds' investments, and the Fund's shareholders will indirectly bear the expenses of the Underlying Funds.<br>
 
						In addition, at times certain segments of the market represented by the Underlying Funds may be out of favor and underperform other segments. The shares of an exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) may trade at a discount or premium to its net asset value (“NAV”).<br> 

						Additionally, the securities of exchange in which the Fund will invest may be leveraged. As result, the Fund may be indirectly exposed to leverage through an investment in such securities. An investment in securities of ETFs that use leverage may expose the Fund to higher volatility in the market value of such securities and the possibility that the Fund's long-term returns on such securities (and, indirectly, the long-term returns of the Shares) will be diminished.<br> 

						An investment in the Fund may be subject to risks which include, among others, ADR, Asset-Backed and Mortgage Backed Securities, Commodities Future Contract, Convertible Securities, Emerging Markets, Fixed Income Securities, Foreign Securities, Futures, Hedging, High Yield Securities, Large Capitalization Stock, Management, Market and Geopolitical, MLP and MLP Securities, Preferred Stock, Options, REIT, Small and Medium Capitalization, Sovereign Bond Futures and Volatility Futures Contract risks.<br>

						To respond to adverse market, economic, political or other conditions, the Fund may invest 100% of its total assets, without limitation, in high-quality short-term debt securities and other money market instruments. While the Fund is in a defensive positions, the Fund may not achieve its investment objective.<br>
						
						Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) trade like stocks, are subject to investment risk, and will fluctuate in market value. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are not individually redeemable directly with the Fund and are bought and sold on the secondary market at market price, which may be higher or lower than the ETF’s net asset value (NAV). Transactions in shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions, which will reduce returns.NOT FDIC INSURED * NO BANK GUARANTEE * MAY LOSE VALUE <br><br>
